## Data Representations
PROVE represents each point on the BLS12-381 elliptic curve in the form of XYZZ, with four cordinates, each 384 bits in length. 


## High-Precision Finite Field Library

### Data Representation
The high-precision data (e.g. 384-bit cordinate) will be decomposed into a vector of low-precision chunks, for which we term as **Chunk Vector (CV)** (I hope u like it once u first time sees its resume[CV] :P).

For example, assuming choosing each chunk to have 16 bits, then a 384-bit scalar will be represented as a vector of 24 chunks.
