# Introduction

PROVE: Parallel Real-time Optimization for Verifiable Encryption 

This is a JAX library enable Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Acceleration

We aim to discuss Engineering optimization that we already put in accelerating the JAX library to be faster.

## Overview of the documentation

**Algorithm** includes the detailed algorithm that we adopt in processing Multi-Scalar Multiplication (MSM) from Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP).

**CodeLibrary** contains the JAX based code library that we developed in accelerating ZKP. It also includes detailed engineering optimizations.

**AvailableLibrary** lists all commonly used libraries and available schemes.

## Table

| No.  |  Prime |
| ---- | ------ |
| 1    |  No    |
| 2    |  Yes   |
| 3    |  Yes   |
| 4    |  No    | 



## Code blocks

The following is a Python code block:
```python
  def hello():
      print("Hello world")
```

And this is a C code block:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
```


## Math

This creates an equation:
```{math}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
```

This is an in-line equation, {math}`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`, embedded in text.
